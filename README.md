This GitHub Action automates the creation of a new pull request. It is designed to be used in continuous integration workflows to programmatically create a pull request from a branch, including setting the title, body, and base branch.

---

## Usage

This action is used within a GitHub Actions workflow. The simplest use case involves calling the action with its required inputs.

```yaml
name: Example Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main

jobs:
  create-pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: pr-creation
        uses: owen-6936/create-pr@v1.0.0
        with:
          branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
          base-branch: 'main'
          title: 'Automated PR from ${{ github.ref_name }}'
          body: 'This PR was automatically created by a workflow.'

      - name: Check the new PR
        run: |
          echo "Successfully created pull request #${{ steps.pr-creation.outputs.pr_number }}"
          echo "URL: ${{ steps.pr-creation.outputs.pr_url }}"
